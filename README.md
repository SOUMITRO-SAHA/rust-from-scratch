# Rust Learning Project

Welcome to your structured Rust learning project! This project is based on [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).

## How to Use

1. **Read** the short Rustdoc summary in each chapter module (`lib.rs`).
2. **Attempt the quiz** by editing the code in `quiz.rs` for each chapter.
3. **Test your solution** using the provided `Makefile` commands for each chapter quiz:

   ```sh
   make run_quiz01   # Runs tests for Chapter 1
   make run_quiz02   # Runs tests for Chapter 2
   # ... and so on for each chapter
   ```

   This will automatically run the appropriate test using `cargo test --test quiz_chapterXX` for the given chapter.

4. **Before running a chapter or quiz test**, make sure to uncomment the corresponding module(s) in `src/lib.rs` (they are commented out by default to prevent build errors for unfinished chapters). For example, to work on Chapter 4, uncomment:

   ```rust
   pub mod chapter04 {
       pub mod quiz;
   }
   ```

   Then re-comment it if you want to skip that chapter later.

5. **Continue** to the next chapter when you pass the quiz.

- Each quiz has an associated test file.
