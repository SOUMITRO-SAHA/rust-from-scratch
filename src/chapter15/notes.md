# Chapter 15: Smart Pointers (Deep Dive)

Smart pointers are data structures that act like pointers but have additional metadata and capabilities. Rustâ€™s standard library includes several smart pointers, each with unique features and use cases.

---

## 1. Box<T>
- Heap allocation for single values.
- Use when you need to own data on the heap or for recursive types.
```rust
let b = Box::new(5);
println!("b = {}", b);
```

---

## 2. Deref and DerefMut Traits
- Allow custom types to behave like references.
- Used by `Box`, `Rc`, etc.
- Enables deref coercion (automatic conversion to reference).

---

## 3. Drop Trait
- Runs code when a value goes out of scope (destructor).
```rust
struct CustomSmartPointer {
    data: String,
}
impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping {}", self.data);
    }
}
```

---

## 4. Rc<T>
- Reference counting for shared ownership.
- Use when multiple parts of your program need to read the same data.
```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
let a = Rc::new(5);
let b = Rc::clone(&a);
```

---

## 5. RefCell<T> and Interior Mutability
- Allows mutation through an immutable reference at runtime.
- Checked at runtime (not compile time).
- Use for single-threaded scenarios needing "mutable borrow checking" at runtime.
```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
let x = RefCell::new(42);
*x.borrow_mut() = 43;
```

---

## 6. Rc<RefCell<T>>
- Combine for multiple owners with interior mutability.

---

## 7. Weak<T>
- Non-owning reference to data managed by `Rc<T>`; prevents reference cycles.

---

## 8. Cycles and Memory Leaks
- Rust prevents most memory leaks, but reference cycles with `Rc`/`RefCell` can leak.
